# GameCheck
Group project for CSE201, Spring 2023. We pulled data from 3 different sources of games (Steam, EPIC, and GOG) and created a interactive graphical interface that allows users to compare and contrast prices and availability for games across different game platforms. The user is also able to search for specific games, search for specific tags/genres, and sort their search results. We used Java and Java's Swing library, as well as a few different web scraping tools.
